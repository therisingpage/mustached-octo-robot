#The Mustached-Octo-Robot Repo
This is a directory that contains some of the code that I have used in Academic Projects.

Examples of these projects include:

######NituShoma – An Android e-Reader

That curates and promotes local African content with support for both written and oral works. The e-reader also supports social media integration. Future improvements to the application include the addition of mobile money payments.

######Kana Kanje – an Android application that helps empower and improve the lives of families with premature children.

The application leverages several features unique to mobile devices such as an accelerometer which helps enable parents to monitor their child’s posture. Local context such as intermittent internet connectivity was taken into consideration and, as such, the parents could save records onto their devices and later Bluetooth the report to the doctors.
